linearRegression.py
===================

linearRegression.py is a little python script that performs the gradient descent for univariate linear regression
algorithm: in this case, the function on which it is applied is the cost function (one case of it).

The script is divided in two parts: the first is the drawing of the cartesian plane which is realized with `pygame`.
I know it is not the best nor the most efficient way to do this, but I just wanted get the job done and learn
pygame's basics.
The second part is the actual gradient descent, which is realized through two functions: gradientDescent and costFunction.
The latter is unused but it is there for later use (if any there will ever be...).

### Format of houseStockPrice.txt
It is fairly simple, and it is pointed out inside the code:
<squared metres>, <price/1000>\n
